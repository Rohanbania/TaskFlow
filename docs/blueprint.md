# **App Name**: TaskFlow

## Core Features:

- Flow Creation: Allow users to create multiple distinct 'flows' or sections, each representing a different category of tasks (e.g., 'Skincare,' 'Study Plan,' 'Work Projects').
- Task Definition: Enable users to add tasks within each flow, including a title, detailed description, and a completion status (tick/unticked).
- Task Reordering: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to reorder tasks within each flow for prioritization.
- AI-Powered Task Assistance: Employ an AI tool to analyze task descriptions within a flow and suggest relevant resources or tips to aid in their completion.
- Progress Visualization: Provide a visually clear and intuitive dashboard for users to view the progress of each flow and individual tasks.
- Flow Export: Allow users to export individual flows as simple text files.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted violet (#9467A5) to evoke thoughtfulness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F4F7).
- Accent color: Soft teal (#73A797) to highlight active elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, 'Alegreya' (serif) for longer body text.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different task categories and actions.
- Implement a card-based layout for displaying tasks and flows, with a clear visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations when reordering tasks or switching between flows.
